# Quickstart: Cross-chain USDC Transfer

## Overview

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/getting-started.html) to transfer USDC from an address on ETH testnet to another address on AVAX testnet.

### Prerequisite
The script requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file and add below variables to it:
    ```js
    ETH_TESTNET_RPC=<ETH_TESTNET_RPC_URL>
    AVAX_TESTNET_RPC=<AVAX_TESTNET_RPC_URL>
    ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=<ADD_ORIGINATING_ADDRESS_PRIVATE_KEY>
    AVAX_PRIVATE_KEY=<ADD_RECEIPIENT_ADDRESS_PRIVATE_KEY>
    RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=<ADD_RECEIPIENT_ADDRESS_FOR_AVAX>
    AMOUNT=<ADD_AMOUNT_TO_BE_TRANSFERED>
    ```
3. Run the script by running `npm run start`

## Script Details
The script has 5 steps:
1. First step approves `ETH_TOKEN_MESSENGER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to withdraw USDC from our eth address.
    ```js
    const approveTx = await usdcEthContract.methods.approve(ETH_TOKEN_MESSENGER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, amount).send({gas: approveTxGas})
    ```

2. Second step executes `depositForBurn` function on `TokenMessengerContract` deployed in [Goerli testnet](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd0c3da58f55358142b8d3e06c1c30c5c6114efe8)
    ```js
    const burnTx = await ethTokenMessengerContract.methods.depositForBurn(amount, AVAX_DESTINATION_DOMAIN, destinationAddressInBytes32, USDC_ETH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS).send();
    ``` 

3. Third step extracts `messageBytes` emitted by `MessageSent` event from `depositForBurn` transaction logs and hashes the retrieved `messageBytes` using `keccak256` hashing algorithm
    ```js
    const transactionReceipt = await web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(burnTx.transactionHash);
    const eventTopic = web3.utils.keccak256('MessageSent(bytes)')
    const log = transactionReceipt.logs.find((l) => l.topics[0] === eventTopic)
    const messageBytes = web3.eth.abi.decodeParameters(['bytes'], log.data)[0]
    const messageHash = web3.utils.keccak256(messageBytes);
    ```

4. Fourth step polls the attestation service to acquire signature using the `messageHash` from previous step.
    ```js
    let attestationResponse = {status: 'pending'};
    while(attestationResponse.status != 'complete') {
        const response = await fetch(`https://iris-api-sandbox.circle.com/attestations/${messageHash}`);
        attestationResponse = await response.json()
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));
    }
    ```

5. Last step calls `receiveMessage` function on `TokenMessengerContract` deployed in [Avalanche Fuji Network](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xa9fb1b3009dcb79e2fe346c16a604b8fa8ae0a79) to receive USDC at AVAX address.

    *Note: The attestation service is rate-limited, please limit your requests to less than 1 per second.*
    ```js
    const receiveTx = await avaxMessageTransmitterContract.receiveMessage(receivingMessageBytes, signature);


    ```

# Circle CCTP - Cross Chain Transfer Protocol

‚úÖ What's the problem?
Blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, and others usually can't talk to each other directly ‚Äî they work in isolated environments (called ‚Äúsilos‚Äù). That means assets and data can't naturally move between them.

ü§ù Cosmos is an exception
In the Cosmos ecosystem, chains are designed from the ground up to talk to each other using a protocol called IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). So Cosmos-based chains can natively send tokens or messages to one another.

‚ùå But Ethereum and Avalanche can't do that
Ethereum and Avalanche don‚Äôt share a native way to communicate directly. So if you want to send tokens like USDC from Ethereum to Avalanche, you need some kind of bridge.

üåâ What are traditional bridges?
Traditional blockchain bridges were created to solve this problem. They allow you to move assets like USDC from one chain to another, usually in one of two ways:

## Lock-and-Mint

- You lock the USDC on chain A (e.g., Ethereum).

- A new, ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù version of that USDC is minted on chain B (e.g., Avalanche).

- Example: If you lock 100 USDC on Ethereum, you get 100 ‚ÄúWrapped USDC‚Äù on Avalanche.

## Liquidity Pool Bridging

- Instead of minting, bridges use liquidity pools on both chains.

- You send USDC to the bridge on Ethereum, and it gives you USDC from its pool on Avalanche.

- Think of it like a bank with vaults in two cities ‚Äî you deposit in one, and they give you cash from the other.

‚ö†Ô∏è What's the issue with these bridges?
They require USDC to be locked up in third-party smart contracts, which reduces how efficiently that money can be used elsewhere.

- They introduce trust risks:

- You must trust the bridge not to get hacked.

- You must trust the bridge operators not to cheat.

- These bridges are also targets for attacks, and many have been exploited in the past.

üéØ Why CCTP is better

- Circle‚Äôs Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) improves on this by burning USDC on the source chain and minting real, native USDC on the destination chain ‚Äî removing the need for wrapping or pooled liquidity.

# How it Works?

CCTP enables seamless and secure transfers of USDC across blockchains through two transfer methods: Standard Transfer and Fast Transfer. Both involve burning USDC on the source chain and minting it on the destination chain, but the steps and speed differ:

## Standard Transfer (Available in CCTP V1 and CCTP V2)
Standard Transfer is the default method for transferring USDC across blockchains. It relies on transaction finality on the source chain and uses Circle's Attestation Service to enable standard-finality (hard finality) transfers. The process includes the following steps:

- **Initiation.** A user accesses an app powered by either CCTP V1 or CCTP V2 and initiates a Standard Transfer of USDC, specifying the recipient's wallet address on the destination chain.
- **Burn Event.** The app facilitates a burn of the specified USDC amount on the source blockchain.
- **Attestation.** Circle's Attestation Service observes the burn event and, after observing hard finality on the source chain, issues a signed attestation. Hard finality ensures the burn is irreversible (about 13 to 19 minutes for Ethereum and L2 chains.)
- **Mint Event.** The app retrieves the signed attestation from Circle and uses it to mint USDC on the destination chain. For CCTP V2, no fee is currently collected onchain during this step, but that may change with advance notice. For details, see the CCTP fee schedule.
- **Completion.** The recipient wallet address receives the newly minted USDC on the destination blockchain, completing the transfer.
Standard Transfer prioritizes reliability and security, making it suitable for scenarios where finality wait times are acceptable.


## Fast Transfer (Available only in CCTP V2)
Fast Transfer is an advanced feature of CCTP V2 designed for speed-sensitive use cases. It leverages Circle's Attestation Service and Fast Transfer Allowance to enable faster-than-finality (soft finality) transfers. The process involves the following steps:

- **Initiation.** A user accesses an app powered by CCTP V2 and initiates a Fast Transfer of USDC, specifying the recipient's wallet address on the destination chain.
- **Burn Event.** The app facilitates a burn of the specified USDC amount on the source blockchain.
- **Instant Attestation.** Circle's Attestation Service attests to the burn event after soft finality (which varies per chain) and issues a signed attestation.
Fast Transfer Allowance Backing. Until hard finality is reached, the burned USDC amount is backed by Circle's Fast Transfer Allowance. The Fast Transfer Allowance is temporarily debited by the burn amount.
- **Mint event.** The app retrieves the signed attestation from Circle and uses it to mint USDC on the destination chain. A fee is collected onchain during this process.
Fast Transfer Allowance Replenishment. Once the burn reaches finality on the source chain, the corresponding amount is credited back to Circle's Fast Transfer Allowance.
- **Completion.** The recipient wallet address receives the newly minted USDC on the destination blockchain, completing the transfer.
Fast Transfer is ideal for low-latency use cases, enabling USDC transfers to be completed in seconds while maintaining trust and security via Circle's Fast Transfer Allowance.

# üõ°Ô∏è What is the Attestation Service?
The Attestation Service is a verification layer run by Circle that watches multiple blockchains and confirms when USDC is burned on one chain. Once this burn is verified, Circle produces a cryptographic attestation ‚Äî basically, a signed message ‚Äî that proves the burn really happened.

This attestation can then be used on the destination chain to mint an equivalent amount of native USDC.

üîÑ How It Works (Simple Flow)
Let‚Äôs say you're transferring 100 USDC from Ethereum to Avalanche using CCTP:

1. Burn on Source Chain
You call the burn function in the CCTP smart contract on Ethereum. This destroys 100 USDC.

2. Circle Watches the Event
Circle‚Äôs Attestation Service monitors Ethereum and sees that a valid burn occurred.

3. Attestation Is Issued

### Circle generates a signed attestation containing:

- Source chain

- Burned amount

- Sender

- Nonce

- Destination chain, etc.
This proves the burn is legitimate and is cryptographically verifiable.

4. Redeem on Destination Chain
You submit this attestation to the CCTP contract on Avalanche.
It verifies the signature and, if valid, mints 100 real, native USDC to your wallet.

üîê Why Is It Important?
‚úÖ Security: Only Circle can issue valid attestations, ensuring the system can‚Äôt be spoofed.

‚úÖ No Middlemen: There‚Äôs no need to rely on a bridge operator or liquidity pool.
